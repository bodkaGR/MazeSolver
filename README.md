***

## About
***

This program was created to study BFS and RBFS algorithms.
In the main menu you can choose the following 4 options. 

- 1 - Generate maze
- 2 - Solve maze by BFS
- 3 - Solve maze by RBFS
- 0 - Exit

1. Selecting the first option, you will generate a maze.
2. By selecting the second option, you will solve maze by BFS.
3. By selecting the third option, you will solve maze by RBFS.
4. By selecting the fourth option, the program will be completed.
